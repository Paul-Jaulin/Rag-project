GenAI's story begins with simple language models and evolves into the complex, powerful systems we see today. Early models like RNNs paved the way for the revolutionary Transformer architecture, which utilizes attention mechanisms to understand and generate human-like text. This advancement led to the development of various specialized transformers for tasks beyond language, such as vision and GIT (presumably referring to image generation). The field continues to evolve with techniques like prompting, allowing users to guide AI models with specific instructions and examples to achieve desired outcomes.

Language model: Likelihood of a sequence of words 
●Both sentences are plausible based on the sounds produced. 
●The task is to determine which sentence is more likely to be said. 
●A language model technology selects the more probable of the  
two sentences. 
“Eyes awe of an..”        
“I saw a van” ""Sea, see the sight"" 
""See, sea the sight"" 
Prob(“Sea, see the sight”) > Prob(“See, sea the sight”)

GenAI's journey began with simple language models focused on tasks like predicting the next word in a sequence. Early models, like those used in machine translation, relied on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to process information sequentially. However, RNNs had limitations in handling long-range dependencies within text.

The breakthrough came with the introduction of Transformers. These models, with their attention mechanisms, could effectively ""attend"" to different parts of the input sequence, capturing complex relationships between words regardless of their distance. This advancement paved the way for the development of large language models (LLMs) like GPT-3 and LaMDA, capable of generating human-quality text, translating languages, writing different kinds of creative content, and answering your questions in an informative way.
