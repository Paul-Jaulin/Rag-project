What is Generative AI 
Generative AI : based on deep learning (ANN), 
generates text, images, audio, and synthetic data. 
It operates via supervised, unsupervised, or 
semi-supervised learning, encompassing: 
1.? Models:  Predict labels from data features 
using labeled datasets. 
2.? Models:  These create new data instances by 
learning the probability distribution of 
existing data, thus generating new content.

what is the generative architecture ? in two 
NLP's. 
●NLP:  generative models are used for the ability to 
recurrently create data, or to search for or create new data in an 
conversationalist 
database (e.g. Wikipedia.com, wikipedia.org). 
●NLP:  generative models are used to solve 
predictions (i.e. the ability to predict. 
e.g. the probability of using a given word in the correct 
syllabus). 
●NLP:  and generative models help in 
creating and writing biological and 
biological replicability features, creating information about  
the biological systems of humans",,,2024-04-14 22:34:43.265606
